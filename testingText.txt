A couple of years ago, at the Karen Rolton Oval in Adelaide, Travis Head, slammed his highest score in List A cricket. Out of the 391 his team scored, Head hammered 230 off just 127 balls and became only the second player in the list of highest individual List A scores for Australia. The fact that South Australia won that game by 67 runs (DLS method) was of least importance, but if you remember watching that game live, you would have known that Travis Head is cut from a different cloth. Drive. Punch. Pull. Heave. Ramp. Sweep. What not? Indeed a couple of balls went out of the park and not really sure if they were traced back till date. Not that Head needed such an innings to reaffirm his credentials, but it was, if anything, a clear indication that Head is primed to do special things on the field. Fast forward a couple of years, the South Australian became only the third Australian to register a hundred in a World Cup final. Remember, there were doubts about his participation after he got injured (fractured his left hand) during the South African tour in September. But soon as he burst on to the
 (World Cup) scene, he lit up the hills of Dharamsala with his maiden WC ton and then wrapped it up with a knockout punch to decimate India in the final.
